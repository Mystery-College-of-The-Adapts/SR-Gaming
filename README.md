# South River High : Gaming w/ C++
This is my repository for all of my C++ code for the SRHS course "C++ with Gaming". This code is used for personal version 
control and is a good way for me to manage all of my projects in one place. All the code you see here
has been done completley by Thomas A. Steinholz, assets are not done completly by me but doesn't change my code. Below I will post a screenshot of the games I make, nothing fancy. Just showing off some of the gameplay and the aesthetics of my games.
