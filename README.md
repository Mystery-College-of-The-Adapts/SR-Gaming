# South River High : C++ w/ Gaming
This is my repository for all of my C++ code for the SRHS course "C++ with Gaming". This code is used for personal version 
control and is a good way for me to manage all of my projects in one place. If this repository becomes an issue becuase of 
peers plagiarizing my code, I will make this repo private for at least the duration I have the class.
